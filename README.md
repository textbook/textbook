📚 Check out my tutorial series on test-driven development in JavaScript:

1. **[FTW]** - the basic principles of TDD, showing unit testing using Jest
2. **[E2E]** - expanding to higher level testing, using Cypress for E2E and Jest for integration and unit testing of a simple Create React App UI with Testing Library
3. **[API]** - more options for test doubles as we bring in API calls and even random functionality to our React UI
